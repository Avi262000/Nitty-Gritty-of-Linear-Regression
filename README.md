# Nitty-Gritty-of-Linear-Regression
#### 1. Learn about the mathematics behind the Linear Regression <br />
#### 2. Different questions based on the testing of hypothesis on estimators <br />
(i) Draw the scatter plot.<br />
(ii) Fit a simple linear regression model and draw the fitted regression line in the scatter plot.<br />
(iii) Report the fitted values and corresponding residuals.<br />
(iv) Calculate the coefficient of determination and comment.<br />
(v) Test whether intercept of the above model is zero.<br />
(vi) Test whether slope of the above model is zero.<br />
(vii) Construct analysis-of-variance table and comment.<br />
(viii) Find 95% confidence interval on the intercept.<br />
(ix) Find 95% confidence interval on the slope.<br />
(x) Find 95% confidence interval on the mean purity, symbolic blood pressure and steam usage
when the hydrocarbon percentage, weight of a male in the age group 25-30 and average monthly
ambient temperature are 1, 160 and 58 unit respectively.<br />
(xi) Find 95% prediction interval on the purity, symbolic blood pressure and steam usage when
the hydrocarbon percentage, weight of a male in the age group 25-30 and average monthly
ambient temperature are 1, 160 and 58 unit respectively.<br />
(xii) Compute and plot 95% confidence and prediction bands around the fitted line.<br />
(xiii) Which is the wider band and why?
